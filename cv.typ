#exp(
  title: "Series of Research Projects in Theoretical Computer Science",
  organization: "Mentor: Dr. Prafullkumar Tale",
  date: "July 2025 – Present",
  details: [
    - Studing a relaxation of proper coloring in which edges with same color are associated
      with some cost.
    - Studied the #smallcaps[Exponential Time Hypothesis], and ETH-Preserving reductions.
    - Investigated treewidth; applied tree decompositions to dynamic programming on hard problems.
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "On the feasibility of parameterized algorithms for VC Dimensions",
  organization: "Mentor: Dr. Prafullkumar Tale",
  date: "May 2025 – July 2025",
  details: [
    - #smallcaps[VC Dimension] of a classification model is related to how complicated it can be,
      specifically in terms of the model's capacity to fit various datasets.
      Precisely, model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
    - Tested efficient algorithms for computing the #smallcaps[Graph VC Dimension].
    - Assessed and compared the parameterized algorithms for #smallcaps[Graph VC Dimension].
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "Reading Project on Graph Theory",
  organization: "Mentor: Dr. Prafullkumar Tale",
  date: "Jan 2024 – Apr 2024",
  details: [
    - Studied #emph[A First Look at Graph Theory] (Clark & Holton) with problem solving.
    - Reinforced concepts: Graphs & their types, connectivity, traversals, matching problem,
      planarity.
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "Scientific Tool for Bridging Model Checking Ecosystems",
  organization: "Mentor: Dr. Arpit Sharma, PhD. Shonak Shaha",
  date: "Dec 2024 – Present",
  details: [
    - The Model Checking ecosystem remains fragmented, with various tools and frameworks lacking
      seamless interoperability specifically between action based and state based model checking.
    - Developing high-performance converters between action-labeled models (#link("https://cadp.inria.fr/")[CADP])
      and (#link("https://www.mcrl2.org/")[mCRL2]) and state-labeled models
      (#link("https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/")[PRISM]) / (#link("https://www.stormchecker.org/")[Storm])
      to enable cross-ecosystem model checking.
    - Emphasis on parser design, memory-efficient graph transformations, semantic preservation,
      and inter-operability testing..

= Technical Projects

#exp(
  title: "Extensively Customizable Exam Scheduler (Graph Coloring)",
  organization: "Vivek Kumar, Rahul Jana, Ayushman Shaha, Dr. Prafullkumar Tale",
  date: "Oct 2024 – Jan 2025",
  details: [
    - Discovered that exam schedules for 14,000+ students and course registrations were being created manually,
      requiring significant effort.
    - Developed an engine that assigns exams to time slots & halls minimizing same-day conflicts ($<=$24h) using
      graph coloring + randomized optimization heuristics.
    - Supports multi-hall allocation when enrollment exceeds single capacity; leverages NetworkX for constraint modeling.
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "Texture Classification & Face Clustering for Image Search",
  date: "Sep 2024 – Nov 2024",
  details: [
    - The project aims to address the common challenge of navigating through directories containing a large
      collection of images, enabling users to efficiently filter and search for images.
    - Pipeline: MTCNN detection → InceptionResNetV1 embeddings → cosine similarity for face grouping.
    - Implemented batching to control GPU memory; evaluated multiple texture descriptors for retrieval precision.
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "Bag-of-Words Chatbot (Context-Aware)",
  date: "Oct 2021 – Dec 2021",
  details: [
    - Built a context-aware chatbot supporting tasks like to-do lists, word definitions, note taking,
      and time queries across timezones.
    - Trained a sequential neural network in TensorFlow on a custom dataset tailored to project requirements.
  ],
)

#exp(
  title: "General Purpose Discord Bot",
  date: "Mar 2021",
  details: [
    - Implemented modules for moderation, games, music playback, jokes & meme generation.
    - The project was written in Python and utilized PostgreSQL database to store every configuration for the bot,
      which was server and user specific. The bot was designed to be scalable.
